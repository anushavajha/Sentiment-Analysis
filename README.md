# Sentiment-Analysis

This project performs Sentiment Analysis with scikit-learn by building a logistic regression model to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative. We use the popular IMDB data set and a simple logistic regression estimator from scikit-learn for document classification.

We build and employ a logistic regression classifier using scikit-learn, clean and pre-process text data, perform feature extraction with nltk, tune model hyperparameters and evaluate model accuracy. We apply the logistic regression classification algorithm using scikit-learn and Python to classify movie reviews as either postive or negative.
