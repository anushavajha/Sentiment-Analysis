# Sentiment-Analysis

This project performs Sentiment Analysis with scikit-learn. 

We build and employ a logistic regression classifier using scikit-learn, clean and pre-process text data, perform feature extraction with nltk, tune model hyperparameters and evaluate model accuracy. We apply the logistic regression classification algorithm using scikit-learn and Python to classify movie reviews as either postive or negative.
